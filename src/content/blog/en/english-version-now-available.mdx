I'm the creator of this website, and i'm proud to announce that this website is now available in English !

## A little backstory

I created this website with my friend [Logan](/logan-sy-forsans) which we use to share our differents passions and projects. It was a great experience and now it's reworked and improved with the help of [Astro](https://astro.build/), a new framework that allows to create static websites easily and quickly!

This site was originally created in French, but now support all kind of languages. All articles are language-specific, so you can find the right one for you.

You can see the list of libraries used for the website's rework on the <Link href="/libraries" title="libraries" /> page.
